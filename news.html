                    series amid criticism</h3>

                <h2>
                    <p>On Sunday, Sarfaraz, who shares the same dressing room with Suryakumar from domestic matches for
                        Mumbai, ended his silence in the ongoing criticism of the selectors' call in the India batting
                        star.
                        BCCI's announcement of India's 17-member squad for the first two Tests against Australia in the
                        Border-Gavaskar series lefts fans, experts and veteran cricketers fuming over the absence over
                        Sarfaraz Khan while the logic behind Suryakumar Yadav's selection in the format was questioned.
                        On Sunday, Sarfaraz, who shares the same dressing room with Suryakumar from domestic matches for
                        Mumbai, ended his silence in the ongoing criticism of the selectors' call in the India batting
                        star. What left fans agitated was Sarfaraz's plethora of runs in Ranji Trophy compared to
                        Suryakumar's lack of appearances in red-ball cricket. The 25-year-old scored 928 runs at 154.66
                        in 2019/20 season, 982 runs at 122.75 in 2021/22 season and over 500 runs in the ongoing season
                        at an average of about 92. Suryakumar, on the other hand, did not play a red-ball game in the
                        last three years until his appearance in a Ranji Trophy game last December where he scored a
                        80-ball 90.</p>

                        Former India captain Virat Kohli is among the three Indian players who found their name in the
                        Men's Team of the Year while Smriti Mandhana and three other India cricketers have been picked
                        for the women's side.The International Cricket Council on Sunday named the T20I Team of the Year
                        for both men's and women's cricket, naming 11 players each, who have impressed fans with their
                        batting, bowling and all-round exploits in 2022. Former India captain Virat Kohli is among the
                        three Indian players - Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya being the other two - who found their
                        name in the Men's Team of the Year while Smriti Mandhana and three other cricketers have been
                        picked for the women's side.Kohli returns to the ICC team of the year after a gap following a
                        fine outing in 2022. T20I was the format Kohli least expected himself to score a century, but a
                        stunning 122 not out against Afghanistan in the Asia Cup last September wasn't only his maiden
                        ton in the format, but also ended his three-year-long drought of an international ton. Kohli
                        eventually ended the tournament as the second-highest run-getter with 276 runs in five games and
                        carried his form into the World Cup where he finished as the the highest run-scorer with 296
                        runs, laced with four fifties. The run-tally included one of the most greatest T20I knocks ever
                        witnessed, in his unbeaten 82 against Pakistan.The two others are Suryakumar Yadav and
                        all-rounder Hardik Pandya. It was a sensational 2022 for Suryakumar, who finished the calendar
                        year as the highest run-getter with 1164 T20I runs, laced with two hundreds and nine
                        half-centuries while striking at a stunning 187.43. The year also saw him rise to the top of the
                        T20I ranking for batters. Hardik, who returned as an all-rounder to the Indian T20I side in
                        June, capped off a fabulous 2022, scoring 607 runs while also picking up 20 wickets.

            <h3>'Umran Malik not as trained or fit as Haris Rauf. He starts at 150kph but drops to 138': Pakistan
                great's daring verdict</h3>
            <img src="umr.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="England Cricket">
            <h2>
                <p>
                    Young India pacer Umran Malik and Pakistan fast-bowling sensation Haris Rauf have been among the
                    two top bowlers in the world cricket at present who have consistently touched the 150 kmph mark
                    on the speedometer. And with legendary bowler Shoaib Akhtar's record in sight, the two pacers
                    have constantly being compared with each other. However, Pakistan great Aaqib Javed sees no
                    point in the debate as he shut it with a savage "Virat Kohli" statement.Haris' fastest delivery
                    so far has been the 159 kmph thunderbolt which he had delivered during the T20 World Cup last
                    year against England. For the 23-year-old Indian, who is the fastest bowler the country has ever
                    witnessed, he touched the 157kmph mark during an Indian Premier League game and his fastest in
                    an international game is 156 kmph.Speaking to Events & Happenings Sports, Javed was asked to
                    weigh in on Umran vs Haris debate and he responded saying that it is similar to comparing Kohli
                    with the rest of the batters in the world, referring the star India batter to the Pakistan pacer
                    in this context.Umran has showed tremendous improvement in the last couple of months, bowling
                    regular thunderbolts and mixing up his line and length well. With the kind of pace he generates,
                    Umran's economy rate is slightly on the higher side, but the pacer has been backed by several
                    former cricketers such as Gautam Gambhir and Ajay Jadeja. They feel that Umran conceding runs
                    should not be a factor as long as his wickets column is satisfying.

                    And rest assured, Umran has done exactly that. Besides bending his back, Umran has picked up at
                    least two wickets in each of his last outings for India, picking up 14 wickets, including two
                    3-wicket-bursts. Umran was dropped for Shardul Thakur in the two New Zealand ODIs, a decision
                    that was highly debated. Umran also received advice from senior India pro Mohammed Shami, who
                    said that if he can pay a little more focus on his line and length, Umran will be unplayable.
